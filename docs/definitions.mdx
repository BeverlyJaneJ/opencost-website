# Definitions

Total Cluster Costs represent all costs required to operate a Kubernetes cluster. Cluster Assets Costs are the portion of these costs that are related to directly observable entities within a cluster; these include expenses from Nodes, Persistent Volumes, attached disks, load balancers, and network ingress/egress costs. From a financial accounting perspective, these are equivalent to the Cost of Goods Sold when measuring product costs. Cluster Overhead Costs measure the overhead required to operate all of the Assets of a cluster, e.g. Cluster Management Fees. These are the equivalent to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A), or indirect costs, when viewed from a financial accounting perspective.

:::tip Total Cluster Costs I

Total Cluster Costs = Cluster Asset Costs + Cluster Overhead Costs

:::

Asset Costs can be further segmented into Resource Allocation Costs and Resource Usage Costs. Resource Allocation Costs are expenses that accumulate based on the amount of time provisioned irrespective of usage (e.g. CPU hourly rate) whereas Resource Usage Costs accumulate on a per-unit basis (e.g. cost per byte egressed). Individual Asset Costs are the summation of it’s Resource Allocation and Usage Costs, e.g. a Node’s cost is equal to CPU cost + GPU cost + RAM cost + Node Network Costs

:::tip Total Cluster Costs II

Total Cluster Costs = Resource Allocation Costs (for all assets) + Resource Usage Costs (for all assets) + Cluster Overhead Costs (for cluster)

The following chart shows these relationships:
