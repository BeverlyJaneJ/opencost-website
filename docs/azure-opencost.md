Azure OpenCost Integration
============

As announced in the [recent Azure blog post](https://www.opencost.io/blog/azure-opencost), AKS has made several contributions to augment OpenCost and enable support with AKS. See the following steps to enable this new functionality:

1. [Install OpenCost](https://www.opencost.io/docs/install) 1.103 or later (current releases as of May 2023).

2. Optionally enable customer-specific Azure pricing:

3. Enable CSV export to Azure storage:
