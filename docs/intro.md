# Introduction

Kubernetes enables complex deployments of containerized workloads, which are often transient and consume variable amounts of cluster resources. While this enables teams to construct powerful solutions to a broad range of technical problems, it also creates complexities when measuring the resource utilization and costs of workloads and infrastructure in dynamic Kubernetes environments.

As Kubernetes adoption increases within an organization, these complexities become a business critical challenge to solve. In this document, we specify a vendor-agnostic methodology for accurately measuring and allocating the costs of a Kubernetes cluster to its hosted tenants. This community resource is maintained by Kubernetes practitioners and we welcome new contributions.
