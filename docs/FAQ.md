**OpenCost FAQ**

**_What is OpenCost? _**

OpenCost is a vendor-neutral open source project for measuring and allocating infrastructure and container costs in Kubernetes environments. 

The project combines the Kubecost core allocation engine with a new community-driven [spec](https://github.com/kubecost/opencost/tree/develop/spec) on how to monitor costs in Kubernetes land. The allocation engine is a Golang implementation that conforms to spec. Both have now been submitted to the CNCF.

**_How do I get started with the project?_**
