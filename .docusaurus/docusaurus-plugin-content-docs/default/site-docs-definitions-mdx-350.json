  "description": "Total Cluster Costs represent all costs required to operate a Kubernetes cluster. Cluster Assets Costs are the portion of these costs that are related to directly observable entities within a cluster; these include expenses from Nodes, Persistent Volumes, attached disks, load balancers, and network ingress/egress costs. From a financial accounting perspective, these are equivalent to the Cost of Goods Sold when measuring product costs. Cluster Overhead Costs measure the overhead required to operate all of the Assets of a cluster, e.g. Cluster Management Fees. These are the equivalent to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A), or indirect costs, when viewed from a financial accounting perspective.",
